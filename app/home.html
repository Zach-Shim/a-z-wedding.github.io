        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>It all began on June 10, 2017, at the YMCA. Zach and Amna were both part of the team, each focused on their work and their own routines. But fate had other plans. What started as casual conversations about schedules and shared responsibilities soon blossomed into something neither of them could have predicted.
            From swapping stories during breaks to supporting each other through busy days, their connection grew effortlessly. Zach admired Amna's kindness and unwavering positivity, while Amna was drawn to Zach's humor and steady nature.
            Over time, their bond deepened beyond the walls of the YMCA. They discovered shared passions, celebrated each other‚Äôs quirks, and built a foundation of friendship that evolved into a love they couldn‚Äôt imagine their lives without.
            Looking back, June 10, 2017, wasn‚Äôt just the day they met‚Äîit was the beginning of their forever. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

        <h2>The Proposal</h2>
        <p>It was a picture-perfect evening, with the golden sun dipping into the horizon and the waves gently kissing the shore. Zach and Amna strolled hand-in-hand along the sandy beach, their laughter blending with the soothing melody of the ocean. As they reached a secluded spot adorned with lanterns and scattered petals, Zach knelt on one knee, his heart full of love and anticipation.
            With the sea breeze as their witness and the sunset painting the sky in hues of pink and gold, he asked the question that would forever change their lives. Amna‚Äôs joyful ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù echoed over the waves, sealing their love story in the beauty of that unforgettable moment by the sea.
            Now, as they prepare to embark on this exciting new chapter, they invite you to celebrate their love and join them on their wedding day. üåäüíç</p>
